# Ngu - boss sniping and loot boosting
Very basic and (hopefully) super easy to use script for ngu. User inputs all coordinats on his own, so it is intended to be
fairly flexible. Currently works on Steam (my use case), untested on other platforms. Will be happy for input on whether
it does - see _Bugs and suggestions_.

## Getting Started

As the app was tested on windows 7 and 10, I expect it to work across windows platforms only. 
Once the setup is complete, a window will open that will guide
you through the functions. Try to experiment :)

### What it does

Currently supports 2 functions
 * Quicker boss sniping (quick-changing zones when boss not present)
 * Boosting inventory gear
 
 Almost forgot tomention - setup your game window as you wish, click whichever items you want boosted. _BUT THEN DO
 NOT MOVE THE WINDOW_ while script is running, it will break the item boost item/crown locations. You can always reset
 by clicking stop or simply restarting the app.
 
 
 These two functions do not work together and are really basic, no health checking, no manual mode etc.
 I don't have specific plans to make this larger, although I may add features as I find them important to me. 
The first and easiest step would be to chain the boost functions with merge and boost, possibly some loot filtering

### Installation

Three possibilities
* Download AllFiles.rar, extract, click Ngu.exe (createa a shortcut wherever you want it on your Desktop or elsewhere)
* Build your own version with VisualStudio (2017)
* (Experimental, untested) Download an installer from Setup1 folder, start and see what happens :)

## Bugs and suggestions
I will be happy for any suggestions to improve - use the official NGU Discord #scripting channel.
I do not intend to put significant effort to this and compete with other great NGU script projects at all,
Having said that, the goal is for this to be a 1-click experience without setup for people who might need these functionalities.
Therefore, will be glad to make small changes to improve experience for others (browser clients esp), why not.
